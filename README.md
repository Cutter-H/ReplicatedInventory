The plugin is now somewhat completed.

Documentation for the plugin will be added to the Wiki soon.

It comes with content for testing purposes. Everything is done in runtime so nothing SHOULD affect any external assets when testing. Although editor assets are not reference, please use with caution if you implement it with such functionality.

Prototype video showcasing expected functionality. This is from a previous version of this project that did not support custom functionality (such as showing a replicated firearm's current ammo).
